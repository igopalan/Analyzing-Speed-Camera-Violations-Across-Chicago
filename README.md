# Analyzing-Speed-Camera-Violations-Across-Chicago
Chicago Speed Traffic Violations from 2014 - 2019
Thinkful Capstone Project #1 - "Analyzing Speed Camera Violations Across Chicago" by Ilango Gopalan, August 2019

In 2013, the city of Chicago announced that 50 'zones' around parks and schools would be equipped with automated speed enforcement cameras. These cameras are part of the Children's Safety Zone Program, and were installed with the expectation of having motorists reduce speeding near the zones.

The dataset for this project is found here: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4

This dataset reflects the daily volume of violations that have occurred in Children's Safety Zones for each camera. The data reflects violations that occurred from July 1, 2014 until present, minus the most recent 14 days. As of July 2019, there are 163 speed cameras in Chicago, across 50 wards, and 77 community areas

A children's safety zone is designated as a 1/8th of a mile boundary around any Chicago parks or schools. The program uses enhanced signage and automated safety cameras to identify and ticket motorists who exceeded speed limits.

Chicago is made up of 77 community areas that are often grouped into 9 districts or “sides.” The community areas are well defined and do not overlap. Each community area has one or more neighborhoods in it. The neighborhoods are often not well defined and over lap each other.

From this report, a reader will be able to answer the following questions:

1. Have the overall speeding violations increased or decreased year over year?
2. How does the speeding violation volume depend on the season?
3. Which wards, addresses, and community areas have the most violations?

Additionally, the report will show areas for future further analysis.
